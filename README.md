# etch-a-sketch
Project: Etch-a-Sketch (The Odin Project)

Thoughts before I start... I'm a bit nervous since the project page explicitly said that this will not be easy! At the same time, that makes me excited. It makes me feel like succeeding will help me grow and climb another step on this journey.

I won't give up, I'll crush this project. I'll come back here to reflect once I'm done!
